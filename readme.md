# Fortknight

A whimsical battle royale game. Playing is half the fun; the other half is learning to code by adding to our wide array of achievements and submitting a pull request!

To play: https://acenturyandabit.github.io/fortknight

Try and beat my high score of 50! Then, pick a TODO item from the issues page to make a pull request for!
